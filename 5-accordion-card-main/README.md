# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion card

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

HTML
```
<details>
<summary>
```
---
In CSS, here are the new properties that I used for the first time  

```
overflow: hidden;
background
  -background-image
  -background-repeat
  -background-position
absolute positioning
  -containing block
stacking contexts

```
It took me longer than I would have liked, but I learned a lot. CSS code can be a lot cleaner, but overall, I am happy with the final product!
