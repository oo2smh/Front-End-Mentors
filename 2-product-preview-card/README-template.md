# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [Product preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## Overview
- Fairly simple layout that I just tackled. This went a lot smoother than the previous challenge

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## What I learned
- I learned how to change images for different screen widths using `<source srcset=" " media='(min-width: 35rem)'`
