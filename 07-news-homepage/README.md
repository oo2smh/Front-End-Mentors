## Process
1. Setup CSS Reset and Custom Properties
2. Look at Design layout and draw and take notes to anticipate any further challenges
3. Draw on the Desktop layout to try to write semantic html instead of using `<div>` for everything

## Questions
1. Should I use `<article>` or `<section>` for some of these groups?[^1] 
2. What about `<aside>` and `<menu>`?
3. `<h1>` should be used as the biggest heading in the page. However, in a case, where there is no dominant `<h1>`. Can you have more than 1 `<h1>` on a page? Will this hurt SEO [^2]

## Struggles

### Hamburger Menu ü•≤
1. Weird Top Gap When Scrolling Hamburger Menu when opened
```
.header__navlist { 
  --gap: 1.5rem;
  position: fixed;
}

header {
  padding: 1.5em 1em;
}
```
Maybe it has to do with the fact that `.header__navlist` is a descendant of `<header>` and thus left that space on the top. I am not sure. To prevent this issue all the while still providing padding to the heading, I added heading to a header child `.logo`. Afterwards, I centered everything using `flex` in the header.

2. Hamburger Menu Icon would show underneath the navlist

The issue here was that within that stacking context, the navlist won because it showed up later in my HTML code. To fix this required a simple fix.
```
  .mobile-nav-toggle { z-index: 1; }
```

3. Hamburger Menu Icon would not scroll with the navlist
This was what my code looked like before
```
  .header__navlist { position: fixed; }
  .mobile-nav-toggle { position: absolute; }

```

Simple fix üëè
```
  .header__navlist { position: fixed; }
  .mobile-nav-toggle { position: fixed; }

```
