## Lessons
I learned a lot from this project. I tried to be much more organized with my html and css. At many points, I was debating between the use of `grid` and `flex`. At some point, `grid` was not working the way I expected, so I used flexbox to align. 

Along the way, I learned about how to explicitly size the parent container of the content by using the `calc` function. I also used `transform` to make finer adjustments. 

To get the spacing between the elements, I tried to primarily rely on `gap` as much as possible.

Finally, I learned that it's possible to place multiple background images and position them.
