# Overview üëã
I signed up to Frontend Mentor after being introduced my Kevin Powell. This was a simple card component with a centered image along with some text underneath. Designs that appear simple and unassuming often hides complexity. This was no exception. I hope that this project can be the 1st of many.

# My Process
1. Analyze the Design. Making note of possible details and writing down what you want to accomplish in plain English.
2. Write the HTML looking at both the Desktop and the mobile version. The focus was on the Desktop version however because the Desktop version usually has the more complex design.
3. Create general utility classes 
4. Layout and positioning
5. Color, Typography, Spacing
6. Box-shadow and pseudoclass `:hover` and `:focus`

## Built With
- Used internal CSS within my HTML (not the best practice) because I didn't think I would need a lot of CSS
- Raw HTML and CSS
  - Flexbox is helpful
  - Google fonts
  - Utility classes
  - Google Fonts

## What I Learned
- Subtlety of box-shadow. Opacity of 25% really works
- `transform:scale(1.1)`
- Images can have a border-radius
- 1st time using `max-width`
- Importance of setup: Analyzing the design 1st before diving in can save you time down the road. Additionally, it leads to cleaner code and a more methodological approach to creating the design
- Training my Design üëÅ I skipped past the style.md to try to match the colors, font-family and font-sizing on my own
